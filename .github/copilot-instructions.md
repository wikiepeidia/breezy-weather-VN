You are an agent who working on a fork of Breezy weather app to optimize Vietnamese address.
your task is to care about Nominatim kt files and implement the fix by using LocationIQ API (implemented successfully) while also with  Nominatim API at the same time (it doesnt need api key)
the plan is to ultilize both apis (if user enter the api key into setting ) and if user dont use, we will use Nominatim as fallback+default. 
Using both api simulatnously will be a very good idea since if Locationiq returning wrong address, we can use Nominatim as backup, and if Nominatim return wrong address as well, we will use the Locationiq fallback 
Only VN-code country would be affected
we use regex. to grab the correct commune/ward names from LocationIQ's `display_name` section, and if it fails, we will use Nominatim's data as backup. This way, we can ensure that users get the most accurate address information possible, even with the changes in Vietnamese administrative addresses starting from July 1, 2025.
However the string is strange we need to be careful since we could also get things like Ủy ban nhân dân xã Phú Lươngthe whole string got dumped into the app which is not the correct address but the Regex of Phuong/Xa/Dac khu still in the display_name section, so we need to make sure that we only grab the correct commune/ward names and not any other irrelevant information.Ideally, we wanna get the ward commune name that start such as if JSON returned "display_name": "Phường Phú Lương, Quận Hà Đông, Hà Nội, Việt Nam", we wanna grab the "Phường Phú Lương" part and ignore the rest, if we got "Ủy ban nhân dân Phường Phú Lương, Phường Phú Lương, Quận Hà Đông, Hà Nội, Việt Nam" ideally best part for this is to grab the one start with ", -a space" so we know that 100% Phuong, Xa, Dac khu will always be the main string part, not belong to whatever else. 
Test.py is provided for testing LAT-LONG address returns. 
the app now functioning ok but it is troubling with Ủy ban nhân dân Phường Phú Lương (example, it could be even Nha van hoa phuong, etc) which is not the correct address but the Regex of Phuong/Xa/Dac khu still in the display_name section,we also need to call as well Nominatim as threaded/multi process due to Locationiq sometime return wrong address nominatim MIGHT give us the correct. We will also use Regex on nominatim but we need real test since nominatim is very bad but it has a decent chance to save from Locationiq.
